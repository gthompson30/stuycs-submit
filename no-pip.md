## Installing pip

pip is a popular package installer and manager for Python, which is a prerequisite for stuycs-submit

To get pip so that you can download the required Python modules, run the following commands:

```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py --output get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
```

This should download and install pip.

I haven't tested it on any computers that aren't mine, so this doesn't work, try [this](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).
